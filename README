# esp-vga-displayer

A small ESP32 project that drives a VGA display and accepts simple text commands over TCP/IP. Other devices on the same network can send commands to update the VGA text output remotely.

## Features
- Drive a VGA display from an ESP32
- Simple, line-oriented TCP protocol for clearing the screen and printing text
- Easy to integrate with scripts or remote tools (netcat, telnet, custom clients)

## Requirements
- ESP32-based board
- VGA adapter/hardware wired to the ESP32 (project-specific wiring not included)
- The ESP32 must be connected to the same network as the client and reachable by IP

## Protocol
Commands are sent as lines terminated by a newline. Optionally identify the client with:
/identify [device_name]  
    Identify the client device with a name (optional).

Supported text commands:
- `/clear`  
    Clears the screen.
- `/print text`  
    Print the rest of the line as text.

Examples:
- Clear screen:
    ```
    /clear
    ```
- Print text:
    ```
    /print Hello, world!
    ```

Example using netcat (replace <IP> with device IP):
```
nc <IP> 1337
/clear
/print Remote text sent from netcat
```

## Building & Flashing (PlatformIO)
From the project root:
- Build: `pio run`
- Upload to device: `pio run -t upload`

Ensure your platformio.ini is configured for your ESP32 board and upload port.

## Tips
- Make sure the ESP32 has an IP address and the client machine can reach it.
- Commands are line-oriented; send a newline after each command.
- Implement client-side retries or confirmations if you need reliability for text updates.

## Contributing
Pull requests and issues welcome. Keep changes focused and document any protocol extensions related to text handling.
